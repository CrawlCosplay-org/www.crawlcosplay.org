<h2 style="color:rgb(69, 136, 5);">About Crawl Cosplay Academy (CCA)</h2>

<h3>TLDR</h3>
<p><img src="/img/uniques/Snorg.png" width="72" height="72" style="float:right">Want to improve your gameplay while having fun doing it? 
With the Crawl Cosplay Academy (CCA), you'll play easier combos of different playstyles as you learn to survive longer. And 
hopefully win many games sooner than later, while playing characters based on 
<a href="http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Unique_monster" target="_blank">DCSS Uniques</a> such as our maskot, <b><i>Snorg</b></i>:

<h3>The gists</h3>
The <b>Crawl Cosplay Academy</b> is intended as a prequel to the weekly <a href="/ccc/ccc" target="_blank">Crawl Cosplay Challenge</a> (CCC) and yet, 
on its own, it is so much more.
<p>As a prequel, it's for players who don't feel they have the skills necessary to compete in the Crawl Cosplay Challenge at a level that isn't just beginner.</p>
<p>In general though, the audience is <abbr title="Dungeon Craw: Stone Soup">DCSS</abbr> players who are fairly new to the game or 
haven't won at least a couple of games.</p>
<br>

<h3>Your Process</h3>
<p>There are 4 playstyles with 3 uniques each:
  <b>Strength based</b>, <b>Dexterity based</b>, <b>Intelligence based</b>, and <b>Miscellaneous</b>. </p>
  Hover over a Unique's graphic to see their descriptions, and then click on one of them to open the Unique's challenge details page.

<p>Each CCA challenge has 3 conducts and 2 bonuses. The 3 conducts are specific to getting you to the Lair and/or Orcish Mines entrance(s).</p>
   NOTE: Do not go passed D:12 before clearing the Lair and the Orcish Mines, as you will likely experience <abbr title="Yet Another Sad Death">YASD</abbr>!
<p>Conducts 1 & 2 will usually be related to decisions you need to take in the early game, and the 3rd conduct will usually be a small challenge to add some fun.</p>
<p>The 1st bonus can usually be accomplished by the time you've cleared the Dungeon (D), Lair (L) & the Orcish Mines (O), while the 2nd bonus will be a bit more challenging and will usually end with something like: "...and get your first rune!" as a caveat.</p>
<p>All of the conducts and bonuses are optional.</p>
<br>
After you complete a good game (with either a <abbr title="aka Yet Another Victory Post (YAVP)">win</abbr> or <abbr title="Yet Another Sad Death">YASD</abbr>), just <b>submit your morgue</b> on the Unique's challenge details webpage. To track your progress, click on your name on that last page mentioned.
<br />
<p>Feel free to submit a morgue as soon as you've improved your score. Your best 2 runs for a specific challenge will be kept in the website's database.</p>
<p>These challenges are built around a best-practice approach. If you broke some conduct or bonus because it was "better" to do so, explain why you did when you submit your morgue.</p>

<h3>Changing your player sprite to a Unique's doll.</h3>
<p>If you'd like to change the player doll to the Unique's tile, add the following to your RC/init.txt file:</p>
<p> tile_player_tile = tile:MONS_WIGLAF</p>

<h2>Q&A</h2>
<h3>Why aren't easy combos like Minotaur Berserker (MiBe) not one of the 12 CCA challenges?</h3>
<p>Simple, you won't find some of the easiest combos such as MiBe because there are not any DCSS Uniques that fill those combos.</p><br>
<h3>Need more help than what's on the challenge details' page?</h3>
<p>Ask all your questions to the Crawl Cosplay community on our <a href="https://discord.gg/pW7nqC8Wu3" target="_blank">Discord server<img src="/img/discord_transparent_border.png" width="18" height="18"></a>. Our @VIPs group will likely be available to help!</p><br>
<h3>When should I start playing the weekly Crawl Cosplay Challenges?</h3>
<p>You can start whenever but once you have 4 wins with one in each of the 4 playstyles, you'll likely feel ready to <b>compete</b> at an intermediate level in the weekly <a href="/ccc/ccc">Crawl Cosplay Challenge</a>.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul> to view your morgue/dump press the # key in-game.</ul>
<ul> add the following to you RCfile (online) or your init.txt file (offline) to have intermediate monsters show up with a yellow backgroung:</ul>
