<h2 style="color:rgb(69, 136, 5);">About Crawl Cosplay Sudden Death Tournament (CCSDT)</h2>

<p>The Crawl Cosplay Sudden Death Tournament is a competition that aims to fill a
Crawl niche not currently filled by the version release tournament or the other Crawl Cosplays initiatives.
The idea is for players to compete by trying to do as well as possible in a
game of Crawl with one attempt only; if you die, that challenge is over (thus
"sudden death"). This competition is a lower time commitment event that aims to challenge 
players while playing 5 of the 100 or so Crawl Unique characters.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<ol>
<li>Each weekly challenge consists of playing a randomly chosen Crawl Unqiue's starting combo (e.g. Snorg, a TrBe). 
The chosen combo for each week of the competition will streamed on Twitch.tv by Dumalacath: https://www.youtube.com/@dumalacath
20 minutes before the start of the new week. A spin the wheel format will be used to make the choices random.</li>
<li>All players have one week to finish a game using that combo. Only milestones recorded during the week (from
00:00 UTC on the start date until 00:00 UTC on the end date) will count for scoring.</li>
<li>Your first 0.33 game started on an official server during the week will count
for scoring. This is the only allowed attempt, subject to rule 4 below.</li>
<li>One redo per week is allowed if your first game ended in death with player
XL < 5 (i.e., no redo once you reach XL 5). The redo game must be started after
the end of the first game (no startscumming!).  The highest score of the
two games is counted towards your score.</li>
<li>Each challenge includes a list of 3 gods. A bonus point can be earned upon
reaching ****** piety (or on worship with Gozag or Xom) with one of the listed
gods. The point is lost if you ever abandon your god or are excommunicated or worship another god first 
instead of the 3 choiced gods.</li>
<li>The tournament consists of 5 challenges total (i.e., 5 different combos). Each
race and background is selected at most once during the competition.</li>
<li>The final rankings will be tallied at the end of week 5 and represent the
final outcome. The player with the highest tournament score is the champion.</li>
<li>Tiebreakers are (in order): number of weekly bonus points, highest in-game
score.</li>
<li>Don't play on more than one account. That misses the point.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Scoring</h2>

<p>Scoring is divided into two parts, weekly points assigned to each game
played, and one-time points awarded once per season regardless of how many
games achieve them.</p>

<p class="notes"> It will not always be the case that earning a
Bonus 2 implies that you have earned a Bonus 1; these points can be
awarded separately. Unless specified, a bonus or one time point does not
require you to win to earn the point(s).</p>
