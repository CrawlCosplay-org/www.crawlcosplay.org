<p>The Crawl Cosplay Sudden Death Tournament (CCSTD) is a competition 
that aims to fill a
Crawl niche not currently filled by the version release tournament 
and the other Crawl Cosplay initiatives.
The idea is for players to compete by trying to do as well as possible in a
game of Crawl with one attempt only; if you die, that week's challenge is over (thus
"sudden death".)* 
This competition is a lower time commitment event that aims to challenge players while
simultaneously encouraging unusual characters and play styles that you might not normally consider.</p>

<h2>Competition Format</h2>

<ul>
<li>Each challenge consists of playing a randomly chosen Crawl combo.</li>
<li>You get <em>one</em> attempt to play each combo.*</li>
<li>The goal is to advance as far as possible (and win!) in each game, scoring
points by reaching various in-game milestones.</li>
<li>Only games played and milestones scored between 00:00 UTC on the start and end dates count.</li>
<li>Details on rules and scoring are available on the <a
href="../about_ccsdt.html">details/about page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>* There is 1 caveat detailed on the details/about page at item 4.</p>
